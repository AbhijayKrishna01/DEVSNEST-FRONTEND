        Respected Sir/Madam,<br>

        With due respect, my name is Abhijay Krishna from IT department, having
        roll number 003.<br>

        I am writing this letter to request permission for attending an Code Camp. I recently got selected for
        that camp and got an intimation from their side by mail.<br>
        The timings of the code camp
        are 18:00 to 21:00.

        This code camp being a really important and integral part of my learning procedures,<br> I request you to
        consider my situation and grant me permission for the same.

        Look forward to your kind consideration.<br>
        <br></b>
        Yours Sincerely<br>
